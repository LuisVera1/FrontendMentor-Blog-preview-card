## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first project on Frontend Mentor.

For this project I focused on adaptive development and the use of the BEM methodology for a more understandable code.

### Continued development

I am going to work on more projects, and at the same time improve the semantics and optimization.
